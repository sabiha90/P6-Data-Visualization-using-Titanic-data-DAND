Visualizing the Titanic data as part of Udacity DAND project 6 using dimple.js and d3.js
Project 6 
Data Visualization using dimple.js and d3.js

Summary:

This project contains the visualization of the survivors in the Titanic disaster. It is an interactive visualization and consists of 3 charts which visualizes:

Survivors by sex
Survivors by Passenger class and sex
Survivors by age

Design:

I already did an exploratory data analysis on the titanic data set during project 2 of the data analyst nanodegree. Therefore, I simply used the data for visualization.

I wrote code using Pandas to find out the male and female survivors and accordingly I extracted the data into a csv file, survival_by_sex.csv and used bar chart to plot the visualization. I used dimple.js to render the bar chart and used svg to render the number of survivals on the bars of the bar chart. In the same way I visualized the survivals according to age.

For multi variable analysis, I visualized survivors by passenger class and sex. And used legends to depict the sex of the passengers.

I created interactive buttons that will allow the user to filter and select the chart they want to view.
